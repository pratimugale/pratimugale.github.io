Hello, this is Pratim. Welcome to my personal website! I am a Computer Science MS student at the University of Delaware, with an aim of studying and researching in Quantum Computation, especially Quantum Algorithms like QAOA, and Machine Learning. I am actively looking for internships and research positions in these areas.

I have completed my Masters coursework in: 
1. Algorithm Design and Analysis
2. Introduction to Quantum Computation and Quantum Information
3. Computer Systems: Architecture

This website is where I write about stuff that interests me, mainly for improving my own knowledge of things because it allows me to think better. Hopefully you find something useful as well!
