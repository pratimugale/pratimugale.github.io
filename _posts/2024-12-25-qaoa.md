In this post I will briefly explain how the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm works and how it provides approximate solutions to Combinatorial Optimization Problems like MaxCut. If these terms are not familiar to you, this blog will at least briefly and mathematically go through these elementary concepts and build upon them. This blog requires that the reader has knowledge about the elementary concets in Quantum Computation, up until some algorithms like Grover's search or Shor's factoring algorithm. I have referred to some great blogs and videos which will be pointed out in the blog and are detailed in the References.

In order to make the overall post not very lengthy, some parts are linked with expandable sections - like <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="expand('learnMore')" class="expand-trigger">this</a> one.

<h4><b>What kinds of problems are we targeting? </b></h4> 

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [<a href="qaoa#ref">1</a>] aims to find an approximate solution to <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="expand('combOpt')" class="expand-trigger">Combinatorial Optimization</a> problems on Quantum Computers. One example of a Combinatorial Optimization problem is the MaxCut problem. The MaxCut problem involves finding a cut - which essentially means partitioning a graph into two sets of vertices, such that the number of edges passing the two sets is maximized. It is an <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="expand('np')" class="expand-trigger">NP-Complete</a> problem.

    <b>Combinatorial Optimization</b> problems - these problems where one has to optimization a function by choosing an element  from a finite set of elements such that the value of the function on that element is maximized or minimized according to what the objective is.

    <b>What are NP, NP-Complete and NP-Hard problems?</b> <br>

    In Computer Science, there are exist some problems that are "easily" solvable. By "easy", we mean that the problem can be solved in polynomial time O(n<sup>k</sup>), where n is the size of the problem and k is some constant. For our purposes, we require 4 classes:
    <list>
      <li>P - this is a class of problems for which there are known algorithms that solve the problem in Polynomial time. </li>
      <li>NP - this is a class of problems for which there are no <b>known</b> algorithms that solve the problem deterministically in polynomial time. There may exist randomized algorithms that in some case might take a polynomial time path to reach a solution. Thus non-deterministic polynomial time algorithms may exist, which is also what NP stands for. (<b>Non-deterministic polynomial</b>, and not non-polynomial). Another point to note is that if a solution to an NP problem is provided, it can be verified by an algorithm in polynomial time. </li>
      <li>NP-Hard - this is a class of problems which are "harder" than NP problems. The term "hard" refers to generalization, which essentially means that all problems in the set NP are special cases of NP-Hard problems. The first NP-Hard problems of SAT and 3-SAT problems were proved to be NP-Hard by hand. Generally, to prove that any problem is NP-Hard, one needs to prove that an existing NP-Hard problem is a special case of the problem at hand. </li>
      <li>NP-Complete - this is a class of problems both NP-Hard and in NP. </li>
    </list>

<h4><b>The MaxCut Problem</b></h4>
The authors of QAOA used the MaxCut problem to demonstrate the algorithm and to demonstrate some proofs. As an example that I will use throughout this blog, consider the following simple 3 node graph. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_1_simplegraph.png" alt="a simple 3 node graph" style="height: 200px;"> 
</div>

The solution to this problem would be the cut shown in Figure 2, where V<sub>1</sub> is in one group and V<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub> are in the other. 
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_2_maxcutsimplegraph.png" alt="maxcut of the simple 3 node graph" style="height: 200px;"> 
</div>


The value of this cut is 2. Following are the values of other non-zero valued cuts in the graph. Note that the total number of cuts in a general graph is of the order 2<sup>\|V\|</sup>.

<list>
<li>A: {V<sub>1</sub>}, B: {V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>}: Cut Value: 2</li>
<li>A: {V<sub>2</sub>}, B: {V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>}: Cut Value: 1</li>
<li>A: {V<sub>3</sub>}, B: {V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>}: Cut Value: 1</li>
</list>
<!--

V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3
$$ -->

<h4><b>Description of QAOA on MaxCut </b></h4>

The algorithm would first require some mathematical notations to describe the problem and the
solution. QAOA assigns a qubit to each vertex in G. Hence, on performing a measurement, the
result would be one of the computational basis states, which would represent a candidate solution.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_3_tablecuts.png" alt="table depicting cuts and values for the graph in Figure 1" style="height: 200px;"> 
</div>

Due to the objective of this problem, it is represented by a Cost function that needs to be maximized. Let the cost function be C, which is defined as:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_4_costfunction.png" alt="cost function" style="height: 60px;"> 
</div>

where ⟨jk⟩ represents an edge between vertex j and k in the graph, and,

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_5_hampart.png" alt="cost function" style="height: 60px;"> 
</div>

The example shown in Figure 1 would have the following C. Since there are two edges in the
graph:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_6_hamparteg1.png" alt="cost function" style="height: 300px;"> 
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_7_hamparteg2.png" alt="cost function" style="height: 300px;"> 
</div>

This would make

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_8_Ceg.png" alt="cost function" style="height: 40px;"> 
</div>


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/images/1_9_Ceg2.png" alt="cost function" style="height: 180px;"> 
</div>







I am still testing the website and will upload the rest of the blog soon. Please stay tuned.
